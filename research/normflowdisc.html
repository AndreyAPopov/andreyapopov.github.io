    <H3>Normalizing flow discriminator-driven particle filtering</H3>
    <P>
Traditional particle filter resampling is driven only by some approximation of our posterior uncertainty. This ignores<BR>
any prior knowledge that we have about the dynamics. In this project we aim to build normalizing flows that act as<BR>
discriminators for the resampling step of a particle filter. The resampling that we propose will reduce the dimension of<BR>
the resampling step from the dimension of Euclidean representation to that of the dimension of the underlying manifold<BR>
of the dynamics.

In the figure above, the left panel has the three standard deviations of a Gaussian distribution in blue, and a <BR>
empirically known discriminator representing the attractor of the Ikeda map represented by the yellow shaded region. The <BR>
Gaussian distribution describes our prior uncertainty about the state of some system (like the position of a target) and <BR>
the yellow outline describes our prior uncertainty about the valid states on the Ikeda map attractor. The right panel <BR>
represents our combined uncertainty, which is a highly non-Gaussian distribution.

The Gaussian distribution can be generalized to any distribution, which is typically a mixture model in the case of an <BR>
ensemble mixture model filter, and the discriminator can be approximated from data using a normalizing flow. A normalizing<BR>
flow is a type of data driven model ("neural network" in "machine learning" terms) that learns to transform between a simple<BR>
distribution such as the Epanechnikov distribution, and a complex distribution like that of the distribution of induced by <BR>
a chaotic dynamical system. Normalizing flows are invertible, thus inducing a discriminator when the initial distribution is<BR>
compactly supported, such is the case with the Epanechnikov distribution.
