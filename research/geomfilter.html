We point a sensor at the night sky expecting to see a satellite. It is not there. As the absence of evidence is not the <BR>
evidence of absence, we have to make use of this information to the maximal extend allowed, but how? My new approach <BR>
reformulates Bayesian inference as a geometric problem of uniform distributions on convex H-polytopes and H-polyhedra. <BR>
In this formulation Bayesian inference simply becomes matrix and vector concatenation. Extending this idea to mixture <BR>
models of uniform distributions on H-polytopes allows us to create methods that converge to true Bayesian inference in <BR>
distribution. This allows us to ``subtract out'' the sensor window from our measurement of uncertainty about where the <BR>
satellite with little additional computational cost.

In the figure above, the top left panel is the action of the ensemble Gaussian mixture filter (EnGMF) on the banana problem <BR>
which is a common problem in aerospace settings. The top right panel is a naive version of a bootstrap polytope filter, <BR>
meaning that the filter simply assumes naive updates of our uncertainty from prior to posterior. The bottom left figure <BR>
is a theoretical polytope filter that generalizes the convex polytope filter to polytope mixture models. The bottom right <BR>
panel is a generalization of Kalman filter updates for polytopes and polytope mixtures, and is probably the most promising <BR>
geometric filter at the moment.

In the figure above a state (blue line) is evolved through a simple ordinary differential equation tracing the path along a <BR>
circle. A measure of our uncertainty about this state is evolved through a corresponding polytope tangent linear model (PTLM)<BR>
represented by the purple square.
