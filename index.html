    <P>
I am a computational scientist; I create methods that enable practitioners to make better predictions and make smarter<BR>
decisions while using as little computational power as is practical. My primary research focus is on Bayesian inference <BR>
and uncertainty quantification in the broad sense, with a particular focus on computational methods for uncertainty <BR>
quantification in medium-to-large scale scientific problems such as multi-target tracking, sensor tasking, data <BR>
assimilation, and equation discovery.

We point a sensor at the night sky expecting to see a satellite. It is not there. As the absence of evidence is not the <BR>
evidence of absence, we have to make use of this information to the maximal extend allowed, but how? My new approach <BR>
reformulates Bayesian inference as a geometric problem of uniform distributions on convex H-polytopes and H-polyhedra. <BR>
In this formulation Bayesian inference simply becomes matrix and vector concatenation. Extending this idea to mixture <BR>
models of uniform distributions on H-polytopes allows us to create methods that converge to true Bayesian inference in <BR>
distribution. This allows us to ``subtract out'' the sensor window from our measurement of uncertainty about where the <BR>
satellite with little additional computational cost.

    <P>
Traditional particle filter resampling is driven only by some approximation of our posterior uncertainty. This ignores<BR>
any prior knowledge that we have about the dynamics. In this project we aim to build normalizing flows that act as<BR>
discriminators for the resampling step of a particle filter. The resampling that we propose will reduce the dimension of<BR>
the resampling step from the dimension of Euclidean representation to that of the dimension of the underlying manifold<BR>
of the dynamics.
